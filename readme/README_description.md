Sprout Life brings the next level of evolution to Conwayâ€™s Game of Life. GOL creates self-organizing patterns that exhibit lifelike behaviors. Sprout Life allows these patterns to reproduce, mutate, and grow more advanced.

From their evolution we can see that there is a trade-off between individual benefit and collective stability. Paradoxically, it turns out that greater reproductive ability and longer lifespan do not always help an organism and its descendants to thrive.
