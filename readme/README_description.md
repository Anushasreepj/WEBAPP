Sprout Life adds reproduction, mutation, and evolution to Conwayâ€™s Game of Life. It's a unique solution that bridges the gap between cellular automata and evolutionary algorithms [[1](#notes)]. 

The game is populated by organisms which reproduce by producing seeds and compete for space. From their evolution we can see that there is a trade-off between individual benefit and collective stability. Paradoxically, it turns out that faster reproduction and longer lifespan do not always help an organism and its descendants to thrive.
