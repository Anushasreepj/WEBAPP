Sprout Life is an evolution simulation with a focus on growth in complexity. We set up an open-ended environment where better, more advanced solutions can always be found, and populate it by organisms that thrive by evolving greater computational abilities.

Sprout Life is implemented on top of Conwayâ€™s Game of Life. GOL is famous for creating self-organizing patterns that exhibit lifelike behaviors. Sprout Life treats these patterns like organisms and allows them to reproduce, mutate, and grow more advanced.

From their evolution we can see that there is a trade-off between individual benefit and collective stability. Paradoxically, it turns out that greater reproductive ability and longer lifespan do not always help an organism and its descendants to flourish.
