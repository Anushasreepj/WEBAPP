Sprout Life models the emergence of complex life through evolution. The implementation builds on Conwayâ€™s Game of Life which is famous for having self-organizing patterns with lifelike behaviors arise from simple rules. Sprout Life take this emergence a step further, creating patterns that reproduce, mutate, and evolve to be more advanced.

From their evolution we can see that there is a trade-off between individual benefit and collective stability. Paradoxically, it turns out that greater reproductive ability and longer lifespan do not always help an organism and its descendants to thrive.
