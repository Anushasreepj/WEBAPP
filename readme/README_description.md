Sprout Life adds reproduction, mutation, and evolution to Conwayâ€™s Game of Life. It's a unique solution that bridges a gap between cellular automata and evolutionary algorithms. Cellular automata were invented to model self-replicating machines, but these machines have been too fragile to survive mutation and evolve.

Sprout Life introduces seeds to facilitate the process of reproduction and make it resilient to mutation. To reproduce an organism only needs to make a seed, not a full grown adult. At the same time producing seeds is still a process which can be optimized by evolution.

Organisms collide with each other and disrupt each other's ability to produce seeds. The pressure of producing seeds and competing with other organisms can lead them to evolve to an unlimited complexity. As it turns out, managing collisions with both friends and foes has a greater impact on an organism's success than simply being faster to create offspring.
