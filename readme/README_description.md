Sprout Life adds reproduction, mutation, and evolution to Conwayâ€™s Game of Life. It creates self-replicating cellular automata which are resilient to mutation, and which grow more advanced through natural selection. This opens up a new world for modelling the evolution of complex life.

In the first few minutes of the game, Sprout Life gives rise to 100s of diverse species of replicators. We can watch as the organisms evolve to compete for space and collaborate with their siblings. In future versions it could be fun to enable competitions between organisms created by multiple users.
