Sprout Life adds reproduction, mutation, and evolution to Conwayâ€™s Game of Life. It creates self-replicating cellular automata which are resilient to mutation and which undergo natural selection and growth to greater complexity. This opens up a new world of possibility for modelling the evolution of complex life.

Watching the current game quickly reveals interesting phenomena. We can see that there is a trade-off between individual benefit and collective stability. Paradoxically, it turns out that faster reproduction and longer lifespan do not always help an organism and its descendants to thrive.
