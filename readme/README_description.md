Sprout Life is a model for the evolution of complex life. It extends Conwayâ€™s Game of Life, which is famous for having lifelike patterns emerge from simple rules. Sprout Life takes this emergence a step further, creating patterns that reproduce, mutate, and evolve.

Enabling reproduction leads to the spontaneous emergence of more advanced behaviors. Surviving organisms compete for space and align in battle formations with their siblings. Game of Life is Turing complete, so there should be no limit to how complex the evolved behavior in Sprout Life can get.

For now you can watch evolution happen by running Sprout Life on your desktop. In future versions it could be fun to enable web-based competitions between organisms collected by multiple users.
