Sprout Life is an evolutionary model that exhibits continuous growth in complexity. Our implementation builds on Conwayâ€™s Game of Life. GOL is famous for giving rise to self-organizing patterns with lifelike behaviors. We take this emergence a step further. Sprout Life treats patterns like organisms and allows them to reproduce, mutate, and evolve.

From their evolution we can see that there is a trade-off between individual benefit and collective stability. Paradoxically, it turns out that greater reproductive ability and longer lifespan do not always help an organism and its descendants to thrive.
