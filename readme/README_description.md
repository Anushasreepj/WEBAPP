Sprout Life adds reproduction, mutation, and evolution to Conway’s Game of Life. It’s interesting that in Sprout Life, reproduction is a life-long process. To reproduce an organism grows from a seed according to cellular automata rules. It's only when it completes the computationally challenging task of making new seed shapes that it can pass on its genes to its descendants.

Reproduction is non-trivial, but not too hard either. It allows room for mutation and improvement. As organisms grow they may collide with each other and disrupt each other’s ability to make seeds. It's amazing to see that managing collisions with both friends and foes has a bigger effect on an organism's success than simply being faster to create offspring.
