- **Open ended evolution** - Sprout Life allows for truly open ended evolution. We want to emulate the rise of biological complexity. Our model creates self sustaining organisms. Initially these organisms are like simple proteins that can barely make copies of themselves. The organisms compete to grow larger, and we can study how greater size creates greater computational capabilities. We believe that our system allows the organisms to grow larger indefinitely, so that evolution can proceed without limit.
