### Working well vs. looking good (draft)

Sometimes it makes sense to sacrifice the effectiveness of our evolutionary model to something that that looks more appealing.
- Adding an extra step when sprouting seeds.
- Displaying results on a bounded board vs. a torus. The boandaries make the movement of organisms easier to follow without them crawling and reappearing on the other side of the screen.
 
### The chaos at the top (draft)

The longer the lifespan of the individual, the more likely it is to produce more offspring. This is usually counterbalanced by organisms wanting to be small, but it can become an issue. For this reason we add a maximum lifespan setting as a limit on the maximum self-destruct lifespan of organisms to prevent run away growth should it arise.

### The search for mutual co-existence (draft)

An open problem is to find co-existing species. Complexity in nature often arises through collaboration, as in the case of mitochondria.
