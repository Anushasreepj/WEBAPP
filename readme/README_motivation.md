Motivation

There are several reasons why Sprout Life is exciting:

Open ended evolution - Sprout Life allows for truly open ended evolution. GOL creates behavior that exceeds it's programming. The rules specify the on/off switching of stationary cells, but this results in moving patterns. The patterns can even do computations that the cells could not. Sprout Life treats these patterns like organisms. It encourages them to evolve to be bigger. As organisms grow in size, they also grow in terms of their computing ability. Itâ€™s exciting because there is no limit to how big and complex the evolved organisms can get.

Collective behavior, not just individual fitness - Collective behavior is the driver for evolution within Sprout Life. Cellular automata patterns are fragile and sensitive to disruption. In order for an organism to succeed it needs to be a good neighbor to its offspring, parents, and relatives.

A rich source of metaphor - A better model of collective evolution is a rich source of metaphor. Beyond biology, there are strong parallels between the success of new mutations, and the success of new ideas in the startup world. Potentially even phenomena like political revolutions or the boom and bust cycles of the stock market can have light shed upon them by modelling the ebb and flow of evolution.

Made for speed - Speed is of the essence in simulating evolution. The ideal is to have a beautiful story unfold in real time. Cellular automata are perfectly designed for rapid computation by computers. Getting the next state of the game is almost like adding together two binary numbers. This is what computers were made to do. With the computer as our vehicle, we can explore the evolving world of cellular automata and learn from our discoveries.
