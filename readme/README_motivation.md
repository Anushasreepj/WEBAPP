### Motivation

There are several reasons why Sprout Life is exciting:

- **Open ended evolution** - Sprout Life allows for truly open ended evolution. We want to emulate the rise of biological complexity. "Complexity" means structures composed of many parts, and "complex life" means that these structures interact to perpetuate themselves. We start with many parts. Cellular automata treats pixels on a grid like atoms. GOL defines a digital chemistry. Sprout Life makes these chemicals behave more like biological molecules. The computer simulates the physics of these atoms, chemicals, and bio-molecules. The point of all this is to retain flexibility, we don't want to tell the system what to do, we want to see what naturally emerges. If biology in the real world is possible, then the right set of rules in the digital world should also be able to create growth towards more sophisticated structures, and that is what we believe we've been able to do with Sprout Life.

- **Collective behavior, not just individual fitness** - Collective behavior is the driver for evolution within Sprout Life. Cellular automata patterns are fragile and sensitive to disruption. In order for an organism to succeed it needs to be a good neighbor to its offspring, parents, and relatives.

- **A rich source of metaphor** - A better model of collective evolution is a rich source of metaphor. Beyond biology, there are strong parallels between the success of new mutations, and the success of new ideas in the startup world. Potentially even phenomena like political revolutions or the boom and bust cycles of the stock market can have light shed upon them by modelling the ebb and flow of evolution.

- **Made for speed** - Speed is of the essence in simulating evolution. The ideal is to have a beautiful story unfold in real time. Cellular automata are perfectly designed for rapid computation by computers. Getting the next state of the game is almost like adding together two binary numbers. This is what computers were made to do. With the computer as our vehicle, we can explore the evolving world of cellular automata and learn from our discoveries.
