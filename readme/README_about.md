### Introduction

Hi, I'm [Alex Shapiro](https://twitter.com/shpralex). I've been playing around with ideas about artificial life for over 20 years, since I first started programming. I've spent a large part of my career building a network visualization product, which is somewhat related in terms of implementation. Cellular automata has always been a source of inspiration. Whenever I need a creative outlet I often find my mind wondering towards making better rule sets to model the magic of life.

I had the insight that gave rise to Sprout Life in December 2015. Since then I've been obsessed with developing the project and seeing where it led. GOL can be written in 100 lines, and I thought that Sprout Life would not be much longer. It's turned out a bit bigger than I thought, but it's still pretty compact. It's small size makes it easier to perfect and optimize, which makes it fun.

I started with a Java implementation because my initial goal was to quickly refine the design, and java is the language I'm most familiar with. Popularizing the application may be better done in Javascript. I think that current processors are fast enough to run Sprout Life using Javascript in a web browser.

I hope that others get involved with this project as well. In particular, I hope that Sprout Life appeals to programmers for the same reason that GOL does - it is relatively small and self contained and produces results that look cool and are fun to talk about.
