# Sprout Life

Sprout Life introduces the concept of organisms to Conway's Game of Life. A slight change to the rules allows organisms to reproduce and to mutate. Now we can watch first hand as organisms evolve.

From their evolution we can see that there is a trade-off between individual benefit and collective stability. Paradoxically, it turns out that greater reproductive ability and longer life span do not help an organism and it's descendants to thrive.

###About me

Hi, I'm Alex Shapiro. I became obsessed with creating Sprout Life in December 2015. 

My main motivation is to hack on something that's relatively small and self-contained. GOL can be written in 100 lines, and I thought that Sprout Life would not be much longer. It's turned out a bit bigger than I thought, but it's still a fun toy project. I'm also excited that it main purpose is to look cool and be fun to talk about.

I hope that others get involved with this project as well. Rather than collaborating directly, I see this as a theme that others can innovate on. I decided to start with a Java implementation because it's the language I'm most familiar with for designing the application. I think that current processors are fast enough to have Sprout Life run in a web browser using Javascript.

One future possibility is that organisms evolved separately on different machines can be brought together to compete on a central server. That is assuming that others are as passionate and inspired as I am.

### More about Sprout Life

Sprout Life is exciting, because it presents a truly open ended model for genetic evolution. As far as I'm aware, most genetic algorithms work on a fixed set of parameters. In the case of GOL and Sprout Life, part of the code is embedded in the body of the pattern/organism. The bigger the organism the bigger the code, allowing it to grow to an unbounded complexity. 

It is also an excellent model of both evolution and collective behavior. There are strong parallels between the success of genes, and the success of ideas in the startup world which I'm a part of by day.
