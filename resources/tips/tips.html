<li>
    Reset often in the beginning. A lot of different behaviors will emerge from the same settings in the first minute or so.
    <br><br>
</li>
<li>
    Increase the window size, which increases the board size.
    A bigger game board usually facilitates evolution.
    <br><br>
</li>
<li>
    Zoom in/out and use "clip to view" button to resize the grid. You can zoom and clip to isolate interesting organisms.
    <br><br>
</li>
<li>
    Flip through the color schemes in the display panel.
    <br><br>
</li>
<li>
    If you see something interesting you can save your progress using the File->Save Genome menu.
    This saves 20 randomly chosen organisms, capturing any battles.
    <br><br>
</li>
<li>
    Load 2 or 3 different files using File->Load Genome to create a competition between saved organisms.
    Competitions use the same Rules settings for all organisms, and rules are updated every time you load.
    <br><br>
</li>
<li>
    If the game has stabilized you can go to Rules and
    1. Increase / decrease the competitive target age.
    2. Increase the mutation rate.
    3. Save first before making changes, and then revert back to the same settings later to create a competition with the saved organism.
    <br><br>

<li>
    Try the other seed types. Bentline to U 3x3 and Bentline to Plus take a longer time to get going,
    but they are more prolific at smaller competitive target ages.
    <br><br>
</li>
    Keep the speed below maximum for smoother animation.
    The maximum speed saves time by not painting as often, and has no other effect.
    <br><br>

</li>
<li>
    Check out the File->Export GIF option!
    <br><br>
</li>
<li>
    See what's happening in the Cell Layer and Genome Layer.
    You can isolate those individually and slow down the speed to appreciate what's going on.
    Turn on Visual Sprout Mode in Rules and Outline Seeds & Young to see seeds turn into sprouts.
    <br><br>
</li>
<li>
    Keep track of Competitive Score in statistics. You'd be surprised how high this can get.
    Competitive score is only an indicator of size, smaller organisms can still win in practice.
    Save the genomes for successful organisms, and we can exchange files online to see who
    creates the winning organism overall.
