    Reset often in the beginning. A lot of different behaviors will emerge from the same settings in the first minute or so.
    <br><br>
</li>
<li>
    Increase the window size, which increases the board size.
    A bigger game board usually facilitates evolution.
    <br><br>

<li>
    Zoom in/out and use "clip to view" button to resize the grid.
    <br><br>
</li>
<li>
    You can zoom and clip to isolate interesting organisms.
    <br><br>
</li>
<li>
    Flip through the color schemes in the display panel.
    <br><br>
</li>
<li>
    If you see something interesting you can save your progress using the File->Save Genome menu.
    This saves 20 randomly chosen organisms, capturing any battles.
    <br><br>
</li>
<li>
    Load 2 or 3 different files using File->Load Additional Genome to create a competition between saved organisms.
    Competitions use the same Rules settings for all organisms, and rules are updated every time you load.
    <br><br>

<li>
    You can browse, load, and share user generated genomes by downloading the SproutLife Genome Gallery
    from github.com/ShprAlex/ SproutLife-Gallery

<li>
    To create fun evolutionary cascades:
    1. Decrease the competitive target age by several points.
    2. Increase the mutation rate.
    <br><br>
</li>
<li>
    Try the other seed types. Bentline to U3x3 and Bentline to Plus take a longer time to get going,
    but they are more prolific at smaller competitive target ages. Boxlid and Boxhat are more likely
    to generate echosystems.
    <br><br>
</li>
<li>
    The "Competitive2 Wild" mode produces the most interesting patterns.
    <br><br>
</li>
<li>
    Keep the speed below maximum for smoother animation.
    The maximum speed saves time by not painting as often, and has no other effect.
    <br><br>
</li>
<li>
    Check out the File->Export GIF option!
    <br><br>
</li>
<li>
    See what's happening in the Cell Layer and Genome Layer.
    Slow down the speed to appreciate what's going on.
    Turn on Visual Sprout Mode in Rules and Outline Seeds & Young to see seeds turn into sprouts.
    <br><br>
</li>
<li>
    Keep track of Competitive Score in statistics. You'd be surprised how high this can get.
    <br><br>
</li>
<li>
    More historical data gets logged to the console that you can see if you run SproutLife.jar from the command-line.
